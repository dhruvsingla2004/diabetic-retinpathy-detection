# diabetic-retinpathy-detection
A deep learning model that predicts the level of DR in an eye

The major task to this project was to explore how things works.
We first started with a basic CNN model.

We used different contrast enhancement layers that imporoves the identifiactions of veins and dark spots.
#Using transfer learning model ResNET50 the model predicts image into 5 classes ranging from 0 to 4 with an accuracy score of 76%.
